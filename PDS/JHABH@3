   After each suboption has been processed, the JH batch selection menu is
   displayed.  This time the generated job JCL is shown.  Since it has already
   been written to the temporary file, it may not be modified.

   Additional JCL may be generated by selecting other options.  Entering
   the%END+or%RETURN+commands will cause the job to be submitted.
   Entering%C+on the option line will cause termination of the JH batch option
   without submitting the job.  Entering%E+will allow editing of the generated
   JCL before terminating the option.

   As with other ISPF options, it is possible to bypass the intermediate
   selection menu by entering%9.subopt+on the primary option menu.  In this
   case the suboption and job JCL parameters are still verified.  If
   verification fails, the JH batch selection menu will be displayed with an
   error message so that the invalid parameters may be corrected.  The job will
   be submitted as soon as ENTER is pressed on the suboption screen screen
   (providing all fields are valid).  Entering the%END+command will terminate
   the option without job submission.  Entering%9.subopt/E+will allow editing
   of the generated JCL, instead of submitting the job.
